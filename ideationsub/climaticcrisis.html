        <h2 class="subheading">About</h2>
        <p>Climatic Crisis is a cooperative-strategic game in which players will have to manage their own assets and make decisions in conjunction with other players to prevent the Earth from perishing from the effects of climate change. Each player will represent a fossil fuel industry/corporation on Earth, and their choices will impact the Earth's well-being in both positive and negative aspects.</p>

        <p>The goal for this project was to create a transformative fun game that uses the elements and principles of game design learned throughout the course. As the user researcher, my responsibilities included conducting playtests, gathering feedback, and translating data into actionable UX improvements for our game. This game, created by my teammates and I, won an award at the 2022 FCAT Undergraduate Conference (UGC) for outstanding project done by SIAT students. More information about the UGC can be found <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fcat/news/events/ugc-2022.html" target="_blank" class="linklight blacktext">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The content present in this page is only the design process we used to create the game. To understand the rules, I would recommend reading a pdf of the <a href="../ideation/Rules.pdf" target="_blank" class="linklight blacktext">rules</a> of our game. The actual game can be found on the link at the bottom of this page.</p>
        <p class="heading">The Problem<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Climate Change Disinterest</h2>
        <p>
        No one really understands climate change. This is because current and previous generation's engagement with climate change is hindered by the lack of compelling communication methods, resulting in disinterest. To address this, we wanted to employ an innovative and relatable channel that can resonate with all demographics, encouraging proactive involvement in sustainability efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="heading">Our Solution<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Gamify The Topic</h2>
        <p>
        Drawing inspiration from the gamification techniques popularized by platforms like Duolingo, our game employs interactive challenges and strategic decision-making to immerse players in the intricacies of environmentaism. Through this approach, we wanted to not only raise awareness about climate change but also empower individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to address this pressing global concern. Our game stands as a testament to the potential of gamification in facilitating meaningful learning experiences.

        <h2 class="subheading">Brainstorming/Research Phase</h2>
        <p>
        For our subject of focus, we chose climate change and the impact of large companies, especially fossil fuel corporations, as our focus since this topic resonates with us and has a critical bearing on our collective future. Given the scarcity of games on climate change, we saw an opportunity to create something unique.

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <h2 class="subheading subheadingtop">Finalizing Our Ideas</h2>
        <p>We envisioned our game based on board game formats like Civilization V and chess, using tiles to visually represent company influence and climate change impact. Due to the use of tiles and territory management, we concluded that a turn-based format consisting of various turn phases would be the best way for our game loop to proceed. We also introduced a boss character NPC, symbolizing fossil fuel companies and climate change repercussions.</p>
        <p class="heading">First Iteration<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Initial Game Layout, Mockups, Prototypes</h2>
        <p>For our first iteration of the game, our game was relatively basic, with the game consisting of only a game board. tiles, and event cards. We initally wanted to test if these type of board game would fit in with the overall theme of our project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="onepic">
            <img src="../ideation/Game1.png" alt="A sketch of our initial game board and the game pieces." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Game1.png', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>After finalizing the first iteration of our game, we got our game playtested and gathered valuable information about our project. I was in charge of leading the research sessions, so I assigned my teammates and I to different groups to take down notes while the game was being played. Some issues we found in our first iteration included the following:</p>
            <div class="threeradius">
            <h4 class="headtext">1 | Lack of User Interaction with Climate</h4>
            <p>We realized that there wasn't enough user interaction with the climate, and so we decided to add a climate counter to simulate how each decision made by large corporations can have a negative or positive effect on the environment. We also added tree pieces which can be bought by the player to protect their tiles from being affected by the climate crisis boss.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="threeradius">
            <h4 class="headtext">2 | Bugs and Unclear Gameplay</h4>
            <p>As this was only our first iteration, players ran into some gameplay issues that made the game frustrating to play. One such issue including a bug where players can instantly win in just a few turns due to their interactions with the board. Some players were also really confused about the instructions as they were not clear.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="threeradius">
            <h4 class="headtext">3 | Not Transformative Enough</h4>
            <p>The goal of a transformative game is to evoke emotions in the player to make them immersed, and our transformative aspect was making players reflect on the actions of companies on the environment. If this issue isn't addressed, our game would not be a transformative game and would fail to meet the requirments. Thus, we had to go back to square one and reconducted research, and we held more meetings to brainstorm ways to tackle this issue.</p>

            <p class="heading">Second Iteration<span class="blink">.</span></p>
            <h2 class="subheading">User Feedback Implementation, New Features</h2>
            <p>During our second iteration of the project, I spearheaded the brainnstorming and ideation of UX improvements. I conducted primary and secodary research by hosting more playtests as well as doing online research to see methods that other games use to emoke emotional responses in the player.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
            <p>Based on the research I gathered, I added a punishment system in the form of red(bad) and green(good) tokens, so that good deeds will give the player benefits and bad deeds will cause the player to fall behind. This imitates real life scenarios, as bad deeds by big companies will cause them to face backlash while good deeds will get the support of the general public. To implement more impactful player decision-making, two choices were added to each event cards which the player must choose between. We also gave the cards a mini description relating to the game to improve the education aspect of the game.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="onepic">

            </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
            <p>During my playtests, I also found that it was way too easy to end the game, since the players would usually clear all the black tiles before it could spread for the first time. Thus, we adjusted the values and numbers of game pieces so that it would be more realistic. We decreased the climate crisis counter as well as the amount of passive income earned per turn to make the players more conscious of their choices. We also created a secondary win condition in which the player with the most money after clearing all the black tiles wins, with each tile they own contributing to the final net worth by $150 each. This way, players will have more incentive to play more selfishly. These changes add to the transformative aspect of our game and make the players a lot more immersed in our game.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Final Playtesting, Game Adjustments</h2>
        <p>After we finished the general concepts and rules of the game, we finalized it by hosting another playtest with our fellow classmates and friends. We reiterated it one more time, this time finalizing the numbers and values in the game as well as changing some textures and game pieces to fit in more with our overall theme.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>For the game board, we decided to increase the size of the board since we found that the players were still able to end the game quickly. We also decided to reduce the climate crisis counter and reduce the punishment tokens needed for an event to trigger to increase the difficulty and introduce a more selfish playstyle. Once that was complete, a few more quality of life tools were added for organization purposes.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Game Trailer, Poster, Website</h2>
        <p>Once our game was finalized, I worked on creating the pitch and official trailer. I used both clips and images in our game as well as climate change videos found on Youtube and edited them into the trailer using Premiere Pro. I also added video effects and transitions once all of the major clips were in the video.</p>
        <p class="heading">Conclusion<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
        <p>After presenting our final game and trailer in class to our fellow students as well as SFU alumni, we recieved a lot of positive comments about the game. During the class, the other students were able to play our final game and give their final thoughts on our game. Since a large majority of players garnered positive comments, we decided not to change anything to the game, and left it as it is. A few weeks later, we received an email our professor Bernhard Riecke telling us that he nominated our project for the SFU FCAT 2022 UGC for best project done by undergraduate SIAT students. Thus, we presented our project yet again at the conference on March 4th, 2022. Overall, I am happy with how the game turned out as I learned a lot from this experience and got to work with an amazing team of individuals. However, if we had more time to work on the project, I think we would spend the time adding more boss and event cards to increase the randomness factor for players.</p>
