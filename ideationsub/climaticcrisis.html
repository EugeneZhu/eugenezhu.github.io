        <p>Climatic Crisis is a cooperative-strategic game in which players will have to manage their own assets and make decisions in conjunction with other players to prevent the Earth from perishing from the effects of climate change. Each player will represent an industry/corporation (i.e: energy utility company) on Earth, and their choices will impact the Earth's well-being, which is calculated in the form of the amount of black tiles on the board. The Earth's land and the player's own land serves as a global health point for all the players, so they will have to manage and make decisions wisely based upon each other's actions to prevent climate change or else they will lose the game. </p>
        <p>The goal for this project was to create a transformative fun game in Tabletop Simulator using the elements and principles of game design learned throughout the course. This final project was created over the course of two months and involved three total iterations before we reached our final game. The game is mainly designed on Tabletop Simulator using it's tabletop game creation feature, with the textures created using Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
        <p>This game, created by my teammates and I, was nominated by our professor (Bernhard Riecke) for the 2022 FCAT Undergraduate Conference (UGC) for outstanding project done by SIAT students. After our project was deemed exceptional by the SFU FCAT coordinators, we presented our project at the conference on March 4th, 2022. More information about the UGC can be found <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fcat/news/events/ugc-2022.html" target="_blank" class="linklight blacktext">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The content present in this page is only the design process we used to create the game. To understand the rules, I would recommend reading a pdf of the <a href="../ideation/Rules.pdf" target="_blank" class="linklight blacktext">rules</a> of our game. The actual game can be found on the link at the bottom of this page.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Brainstorming/Research Phase</h2>
        <p>
        To begin with the project, my team and I brainstormed societal issues we wanted to address through our game. We discussed our ideas during our lab times as well as over Discord, and made a brainwriting sheet on Miro so we could jot down and discuss our ideas. After a few days of discussing various important issues, we decided as a collective to create a transformative game based on climate change and how large companies, especially fossil fuel companies, contribute significantly to this issue. We chose to do our project on this topic because it is a topic that we are all passionate about and affects all of our futures, which makes it an important topic to address. Additionally, there weren't many existing games that touch upon climate change, and we wanted to take advantage of this as we wanted to create a one of a kind game.

        <div class="lefttext">
        <p>We also believed that a game would be a good approach to this problem as games are a very immersive form of media. Compared to other media, a game format engages the player by giving them a first hand experience of what big companies do that drastically affect climate change and the disasters that it causes. By putting the players into the roles of large corporations we can show them how corporate greed often comes at a large cost (in the case of our game, climate change). Players will also experience the reasons why these large companies refuse to fully commit to stopping climate change, which allows players to contemplate incentives for companies on how to reach a consensus between losing the Earth to climate change and having these companies go bankrupt from lack of profit (transformative experience).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>After choosing our topic, we decided to do some inspiration research relating to this topic so that we would have a general idea of how we would like to present our topic through a game. We did research on various media, including games as well as videos and articles relating to our topic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>For our initial idea, we came up with the basics of how our game would look like. Since we have all played board games before, it was quite easy to think about types of board games we could base our game off of. We settled on a tile format for our game, drawing our inspiration from games such as Sid Meier's Civilization V and chess. We thought this would be a good way to give players a visual representation of the impact and influence of companies, as well as the impact of climate change. Due to the use of tiles and territory management, we concluded that a turn-based format consisting of various turn phases would be the best way for our game loop to proceed. In addition to the players, we created a boss character npc to act as an abstract representation of fossil fuel companies and the negative impacts of climate change.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">First Iteration: Initial Game Layout, Mockups, Prototypes</h2>
        <p>For our first iteration of the game, our game was relatively basic, with the game consisting of only a game board. tiles, and event cards. We initally wanted to test if these type of board game would fit in with the overall theme of our project. After confirming that this is something that we wanted to move on with, we began brainsrtorming more ways to make the game feel realistic and simulate how the real world works. We realized that there wasn't enough user interaction with the climate, and so we decided to add a climate counter to simulate how each decision made by these large corporations can have a negative or positive effect on the environment. We also added tree pieces which can be bought by the player to protect their tiles from being affected by the climate crisis boss.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>After finishing the first iteration of our game, we presented it to our classmates and professor, whom playtested our game and gave us valuable information about our project. I was in charge of leading the research sessions, so I assigned my teammates and I to different groups to take down notes while the game was being played. During our first playtest, we ran into someissues with research gathering, so we redid the playtests again later that week to gather all the research we needed. Afterwards, based on the research gathered, the players really enjoyed our game, but there were a few issues we needed to address, such as bugs and clarity. However, the major issue we had with the game was that it did not feel like a transformative game. What a transformative game needs to do is it needs to evoke emotions in the player to make them immersed, and for our game the transformative aspect was making them think more about the actions of big companies on the environment. Having this issue is a major problem in our game because if it cannot make the players emotional and immersed in the game, it would not be a transformative game and would fail to meet the requirments. Thus, we had to go back to square one and research how big companies affect the environemnt and citizens, and we hopped on more calls to brainstorm ways to get around this issue.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Second Iteration: User Feedback Implementation, New Features</h2>
            <p>To separate and organize our workflow, we made an eisenhower matrix and utilized stack ranking so that we would not accidentally work on the same things. We delegated tasks, and my teammate Louis and I were tasked with finding ways to make the game more transformative and fix any bugs in the game. We did this by playtesting more with friends as well as doing inspiration research using Google to see methods that games use to emoke emotional responses in the player.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="onepic">
            <img src="../ideation/Eisenhower.png" alt="An eisenhower matrix depicting what we needed to do as a group for the next few iterations." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Eisenhower.png', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
            <p>Once we finished our user research, we moved on to implementing these ideas into the game. Based on the research Louis and I gathered, we decided to add a punishment system in the form of red(bad) and green(good) tokens, so that good deeds will give the player benefits and bad deeds will cause the player to fall behind. This imitates real life scenarios, as bad deeds by big companies will cause them to face backlash from climate change activists as well as government compliance laws, while good deeds will get the support of the general public. Once the player reachs five red or green tokens, the other players can choose a punishment for the player getting punished. We also wanted to implement more player decision-making since being the boss of a large company requires them to make important decisions that will affect them and their business. Thus, we decided to make the event cards have two choices, and the player must choose one of the options once they draw. We also gave the event and boss cards a mini description relating to climate change and the company the player plays so that the events have more relevancy and meaning for the player and the environment.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="onepic">
                <img src="../ideation/Cards.jpg" alt="Event cards showing two events that the player must choose between." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Cards.jpg', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
            </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
            <p>Another piece of feedback we saw was that it was way too easy to end the game. Since it usually takes five rounds to reach a climate crisis and have the black tiles spread outwards, the players would usually reach the black tiles in the middle and clear all the tiles before it could spread for the first time. Based on our research, this becomes unrealistic because of a few reasons. Firstly, big oil companies earn money from mining for resources, and they typically ignore the small amounts of pollution they produce. They also ignore the damage they have on the wildlife nearby so that they can focus on harvesting resources and earning more money. Thus, we adjusted the values and numbers of game pieces so that it would be more realistic. Firstly, we decreased the climate crisis counter to 4 turns instead of five, and we also decreased the amount of passive income earned per turn from $300 to $200 to make the players more conscious of their spending. We also created a secondary win condition in which the player with the most money after clearing all the black tiles wins, with each tile they own contributing to the final net worth by $150 each. This way, players will play more selfishly and be less willing to spend their earnings to take the incentive and clear the polluted black tiles, as it could cost them the victory. This can also cause conflict among the players, as they will pressure other players to do the good deeds while trying to keep as much money to themselves, much like competing companies in real life. These changes add to the transformative aspect of our game and make the players a lot more immersed in our game.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <h2 class="heading">Third Iteration: Final Playtesting, Game Adjustments</h2>
        <p>After we finished the general concepts and rules of the game, we finalized it by hosting another playtest with our fellow classmates and friends. We reiterated it one more time, this time finalizing the numbers and values in the game as well as changing some textures and game pieces to fit in more with our overall theme.</p>
        <p>Once we recieved feedback, we changed a few more things. For the game board, we decided to increase the size of the board from 8x8 to 10x10 since we found that the players were still able to clear the black tiles extremely fast and end the game. We also decided to reduce the climate crisis counter down to 3 instead of 4 and reduced the punishment tokens needed from 5 to 3 tokens for an event to trigger. This way, the game is a lot more tough for the players as they must make choices that have bigger consequences. Once that was complete we just added storage locations for all of the tiles and game pieces and created more boss and event cards relating to climate change.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <h2 class="heading">Game Trailer, Poster, Website</h2>
        <p>Once our game was finalized, we were tasked with making a poster, website, and trailer for the game. Since I had the most experience with editing and making videos, I worked on creating the pitch and official trailer. My teammate Zev helped me voice the trailers, and after she sent me the mp3 files, I started the editing on Premiere Pro. I used both clips and images in our game as well as climate change videos found on Youtube and edited them into the trailer. I also added video effects and transitions once all of the major clips were in the video. While I was busy with this, my teammates worked on the game poster as well as the website.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Final Thoughts<span class="blink">.</span></h2>
        <p>After presenting our final game and trailer in class to our fellow students as well as SFU alumni, we recieved a lot of positive comments about the game. During the class, the other students were able to play our final game and give their final thoughts on our game. Since a large majority of players garnered positive comments, we decided not to change anything to the game, and left it as it is. A few weeks later, we received an email our professor Bernhard Riecke telling us that he nominated our project for the SFU FCAT 2022 UGC for best project done by undergraduate SIAT students. Thus, we presented our project yet again at the conference on March 4th, 2022. Overall, I am happy with how the game turned out as I learned a lot from this experience and got to work with an amazing team of individuals. However, if we had more time to work on the project, I think we would spend the time adding more boss and event cards to increase the randomness factor for players.</p>
