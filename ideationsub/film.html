        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>For our final project, we had to create a video documenting and representing COVID. For our project, we wanted to create a video showcasing how different personality types have been affected variously from COVID and the lockdown COVID brought.</p>
        <p>I created this video over the course of two months alongside my partner Kirill Tsoy. The process that got us to the final product involved a lot of planning and brainstorming, which we did throughout the whole course of the project. When Kirill and I partnered up, we both agreed to do a documentary for the project because we both had experience with watching documentaries and we also had people who could be interviewed for it. For this video project, I did the interviews, filmography, and video editing, while my partner Kirill did the filmography as well as the soundtracks of the film. The filmography was a collaboration between my partner and I. We split the roles like this because this way we could utilize our strengths to make a good documentary film.</p>
        <h3>Brainstorming/Research Phase</h3>
        <p>In the brainstorming phase at the very start of our project, we brainstormed ideas while walking through the streets of Surrey to find and plan the best shots to use that will fit in and enhance the mood that the interviewees are describing. We marked sections on the map that we felt were suitable filmmaking locations. After getting our setting organized, the next step was to create the plot of our documentary. Our initial idea for our plot was to get two interviewees working in different fields to talk about their jobs and how the COVID pandemic affected them differently. We chose to do this because both Kirill and I had jobs prior to COVID, so we know what it's like to lose our jobs and have our livelihoods affected. Thus, we wanted to document this through a documentary so future people would have a glimpse of what it was like. </p>
        <h3>First Iteration: Storyboard, Mood Board</h3>
        <p>
        Once we had our plot in place, the next step was to make a storyboard with all the scenes in our film. We created the storyboard after watching other documentaries and seeing how they placed every scene to make it appealing and attention-grabbing throughout the whole film, and thus we used some of these ideas as inspiration for our documentary. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext">
        <p>Once we finished making our storyboard, we had the chance to revise it by getting it peer-reviewed to make it better. We incorporated our feedback into the new storyboard below.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During this phase of our project, we also had to make a mood board depicting the overall feel that we were trying to convey through the film. Since our film was about employees losing their jobs due to a virus that has killed millions of people and affected billions on a personal level, we wanted our film to have a very dark and depressing tone to it to truly convey how scary the pandemic and lockdown was to everyone who experienced it. Thus, we chose to include images that included people in a dark setting all alone as well as a dark blue and grey color scheme to represent these themes.</p>

        <h3>Second Iteration: Rough Film</h3>
        <p>At this point of our project, we were done with all of the process work for our video. Thus, our next step was to get in touch with our interviewees and do the interviews as well as film all of the scenes. However, at this stage, we ran into some struggles with our project. During this week of the project, Kirill injured his foot at his workplace and couldn't film his scenes. Thus, we had to improvise and think of ways to work around this. Since Kirill's interviewee was only available during this week, we had to change our plans and make a new plot. Since we wanted to keep our idea of documenting how different people were affected by the COVID pandemic. After brainstorming themes that we could do, we decided to do a documentary on how different personalities affected people differently during the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown. Thus, Kirill got in contact with his extroverted friend and scheduled an interview with him the week after, while I got in contact with my introverted friend and scheduled an interview with him in a few days. Since Kirill couldn't do his interview before the rough draft of the video was due, I just did the interview with my interviewee and edited the footage and scenes for the rough video. Since I only had half of the content needed for the final video, I decided to add more scenes of the interview to substitute the missing parts that we couldn't add to the rough draft.</p>

        <h3>Third Iteration: Final Film</h3>
        <p>The following week of the assignment, we were on our final stretch of our project. Kirill got in contact with his interviewee and was able to film his interview, while I spent the time editing the video and making it more visually appealing. This included doing some more transition shots, adding more b-rolls, and color grading the video to match the overall mood that we set on the mood board. Once, Kirill was done his interview, I added and edited his shots, while Kirill made the background soundtracks and instrumentals we used in our film. Once I recieved everything, I put all of the clips together and uploaded the final video to Youtube.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Overall, I am happy with how the video turned out. Although my partner and I faced many setbacks and challenges, we managed to push through and create a film that documented the struggles different people faced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. If we had more time to work on this project however, I definitely think that I would fine-tune the video quality as well as shoot some more b-rolls to help enhance the aspects of the film better for the viewer.</p>
