        <p>For our final project for our materials design class, we had to design a webcam using two main materials that were given to us at random. Additionally, we were graded on how we utilized these materials to design an unique webcam that addresses a user experience issue that other webcams do not. This project took around 2 months of process and iterative design before we arrived to the final product.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Assigning Materials</h2>
        <p>To start off this project, our professor assigned us with our materials. We pulled notes out of a hat to determine our materials. Upon pulling out our materials, we received the materials wood and fabric as the main materials to make our webcam out of. Once we received our materials, we spent around two weeks performing high level research on our materials as well as existing webcams to see how we can integrate our materials into a webcam design. Our materials weren't commonly used in webcams, so we had quite a hard time with the research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>Since we could not find any webcams that use both wood and fabric, we widened our scope of products that we would look into that utilized both materials. By doing this we discovered a lot more products that we could base our research off of as well as discovered new ways to incorporate the two materials together that is not commonly seen. The images below are a table and headphone that we conducted research on.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Preparation Phase</h2>
        <p>For the first two weeks of the project, we were tasked with learning about how to make physical prototypes using different materials. To do this, our professor assigned each of us to create a model of a flashlight that is designed for a specific user audience. I was assigned to create a flashlight for construction workers that mainly work in dark environments, and thus I prototyped a flashlight based on this as seen in the below image. The goal of this prototype was just to help us get used to creating physical models using different materials. Please note that I am not going very in depth with this since this was a separate project but still somewhat relates to our overall project creation.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Week 1</h2>
        <p>For the first official week of working on the webcam, each member of the team created 3 sketches of different webcams using pens and markers. From last week's research and inspiration from our peer's posters, we created new designs for the webcam while taking our materials into consideration.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Week 2</h2>
        <p>Using the feedback from last week's sketches, each member of our team chose one of our own sketches to create models with styrene. We were allowed to use other materials as well, but the model had to incorporate styrene in some part of it.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>For my model, I experimented with using different materials to make my model. The materials used for my model include styrene for the cover, a popsicle stick for the hinge, styrofoam for the camera cap as well as the camera itself, paper for the midsection and legs, and fabric for the bottom of the camera. The camera cover can move back and forth based on the user moving the hinge. I made the camera detachable from the tripod stand so that they can set it onto their device screen. If the user wants to put the camera on the ground instead, they can put it onto the tripod stand, and they can adjust the legs to angle it the way that they want it.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Week 3</h2>
        <p>For this week, we shared our prototypes and had to choose one to refine and create our final prototype with. After sharing our creations, we decided to combine our ideas together as each of our webcams filled different needs of our users. We combined several different features from the previous week's prototypes. From the feedback given in class, we kept the rotation of the camera so the webcam can rotate horizontally and the user can adjust the angle of the camera lens from my webcam. In addition, the user can also pull down the cover to protect the speakers as well as the camera, which is also something I implemented.</p>
        <p>Our goal with our design was to make the webcam adjustable to suit the user's needs. As shown through our persona, they are someone who is going to be in a lot of different places when using it. Thus, we implemented many features that allow the user the freedom to do so. The webcam can be pulled to change the height. There is also a piece of super lock velcro to make the webcam detachable from the stand and to be able to be put on other surfaces that the user puts super lock velcro on. Since the webcam has a flat bottom, it can also be places on another flat surface. Otherwise, the webcam can rest on the stand, which has notches to allow the webcam to rest on various angles. There is also a guard in the front to prevent the webcam from tipping over 90 degrees.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Week 4</h2>
        <p>Week 4 was our final week to get all of our parts lasercut and assembled before we began preparations for next week's presentations. To begin, we redimensioned our webcam pieces to make it completely accurate and to make sure nothing was missing from our physical model.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>Once we had our webcam fully dimensioned, we moved on to lasercutting the parts at our lab. We had already bought the walnut wood and leather fabric earlier, so we moved to cutting our pieces. Since my partners did not have Illustraor at that time, I went to the lab with the file and received the pieces. We then met up at our classroom to assemble the pieces. I assembled the body of the webcam while my partners worked on the head and the stand, and we assisted each other when needed. On the way we ran into some problems that delayed our progress. The biggest was when we accidentally glued the wrong parts together for the head and body, which caused us to have to recut some of the pieces and reglue them together. This took about 3 days of work to get it to look perfect, but in the end, we managed to pull it off and have it done by the start of our next class.</p>

        <p>In our final week, we worked mostly on the slides for our final presentation.

Below are two of the slides that we presented.</p>

        <p>Looking back at this project, I learned a lot about materials and designing physical models. I've never really had the chance to create physical products rather than digital, so working on this project was like a breath of fresh air for me. Working with my amazing teammates on something new was also an experience that I really enjoyed. Overall, I think that our final product came out beautifully, as everything looked as how we designed it digitally. However, if I had more time, I would definitely work on implementing the actual camera into it and making it able to record footage.</p>
