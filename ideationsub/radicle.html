        <h2 class="subheading">What is Radicle?</span></h2>
        <p>This summer, I had the pleasure of interning at an amazing company called <a href="https://radiclebalance.com/" target="blank_" class="linklight blacktext">Radicle</a>. I was an UX design intern on the software team, where we were working on creating a brand new SaaS product for companies that want to improve and measure their sustainability practices. I was working under our team's senior product manager, Stephan Becker. We also recently got acquired by BMO during my tenure here, so that was quite exciting as well!</p>

        <p>Over the course of my internship, I was able to take on many roles to assist my team in developing and improving our SaaS software. The image above is a timeline of what I've worked on over the course of 4 months. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot give a detailed walkthrough of everything I worked on, so I'll briefly go over some of the main activities I contributed to. Please note that some images will be blurred to prevent exposure of any important information.</p>
        <p class="heading">The Problem<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Radicle's SaaS software was not user-friendly</span></h2>
        <p>In the current SaaS software, there were a lot of UX problems. This is because when it was created, there were no proper UX designers working on it, and was created solely by the software developers. Thus, while it was designed for functionality, it wasn't designed with usability and user experience in mind. To improve it, Radicle hired my team and I to work on improving the SaaS and to discover new opportunities in the current credit development field.</p>
        <p class="heading">May 2022 Work<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Learning about Radicle, Conducting Research</h2>
        <p>Throughout my time here at Radicle, a lot of emphasis was put into research. Since we're still in the development phase of turning our software into a SaaS product, we need to conduct a lot of research to turn it into a top of the line software. For the first month, I was mainly focused on learning more about Radicle's inner workings as well as learning about the carbon emission/credit field in general. The credit development industry was something that was brand new for me, and it was quite complicated too due to all the new terminology I had to learn. To assist myself in learning about this, I conducted market research and user research to take in the processes of emission reduction and credit generation.
        </p>
        <p>I conducted market research by using various search engines like google to find carbon credit generation software and then found as much information about their software as possible. Some examples of companies I looked at include Bluesource, Intricate Group, ClimeCo., and many more. I gathered research ranging from main industry these companies are in to the services they provide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>User research was another part that I played a role in. I assisted our main user researcher, Lauren, with note taking during interviews as well as transcribing the video recording to make the transcript more legible. Afterwards, we reviewed each interview to find common pain points and issues that are present in the current state of our software, as well as finding areas of the credit development field that we can improve. We made a research board on Miro and plotted down all of our findings in an organized sheet. Since our software had a lot of usability errors and has not been tested by many other users outside of our company, my team and I spent a lot more time on this phase, which was the problem discovery phase. Our team mainly utilized the Zendesk Triple Diamond process to complete product discovery for our software.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>Once we had all of our info written down, we moved onto beginning the ideation phase of our process.</p>
        <p class="heading">June 2022 Work<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Ideation</h2>  
        <p>Once we gathered enough research to push our work to the next stage, I was assigned to create user flows and start brainstorming about how we can improve the software as well as what we should add to the software for our user stakeholders. At this phase, our team already defined the main problems and touchpoints through doing research, and thus we were able to move on to ideating general ideas and solutions to any user issues and pain points. Throughout the month, Stephan hosted weekly meetings with our team to brainstorm solutions and discuss our ideas through meetings such as PI planning meetings and product meetings. </p>
        <p>Using research gathered from both users and other software in the carbon credit field, I brainstormed ideas on Miro by performing a SWOT analysis to help my team generate ideas that would give our team a competitive edge over other credit development software. To make sure that the ideas were diverse and reduce bias, I introduced my analysis to my team during a product meeting at the beginning of July and gathered feedback and ideas from them as well. To help my team with discovering problems throughout the user journey, I also implemented empathy mapping to the user flows to identify key sections that are frustrating and time consuming. I highlighted each section using red, yellow, and green markers based on the amount of users that found it detrimental to the overall usability of the software.

        <h2 class="subheading">Prototyping</h2>
        <p>Early-mid July was when I was able to begin prototyping and utilizing my design skills to begin creating our ideas that we were researching and ideating for a little over two months. Since our product manager Spencer was tasked with working on prototypes during this phase, I worked under him for this month. We held weekly meetings so I could update him on the my prototyping and research. There were two features that I focused on prototyping, which were a custom save search feature as well as a bulk upload feature.</p>
        <p>To begin, I researched other similar features that exist in similar software to see how they integrated them into the current interface. Using our previous notes and research done during the iteration phase as well as following best design practices, I created three different variations of the custom save search feature as well as one variation of the bulk upload feature in Figma.</p>
        <p>Since we did not have a plan of how the features would look like as well as where they would go, I was able to use my design knowledge to design different variations of the features that would give the best user experience. Each of the variations I created followed the current interface design of the platform and was created with user input of the feature itself in mind. Below is an example of one of the three variations that I created (everything not blurred was designed by me).</p>

        <p class="heading">August 2022 Work<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Research, Ideation, Prototyping</h2>
        <p>August was the busiest month for my supervisor due to the amount of product work that needed to be done. Thus, he assigned me to work with Jenny, our senior product designer who had just recently joined the company as well, on our current software. Jenny assigned me to work on a specific section of the software called the QC Tool and improve it, as that is the section of the software that our data teams uses the most. I was allowed free reign for this task since my supervisor was busy and Jenny was focusing on other sections of ECAS. Thus, I utilized all of the things I learned during my time at Radicle and implemented it into my design process to improve the overall user experience.</p>
        <p>I began by gathering some general information about the QC tool itself as well as the users. Firstly, I tested the tool itself to get the hang of it as well as understand all of the processes that exist within. Once I had a good understanding of the platform, I contacted all of the members on the data team at Radicle for a brief meeting about the QC Tool so I could gather some resarch about how they use it. I found time with each member for a 1 on 1 meeting to ask questions for a brief 30 minutes. During our meetings, I would ask various questions about the software and jotted down some key notes that were key to improving the user experience of the application. Once I interviewed everyone on the data team, I rewatched all of the interviews and took note of any points that everyone had. I made a board on Miro and added all of the main points that I wanted to highlight about the members of the data team.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="../ideation/radiclenotes.png" alt="My notes that I took for the QC Tool." onclick="window.open('../ideation/radiclenotes.png', '_blank');">
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>Once I reviewed the interviews and created my brainstorming board, I easily identified sections of the platform that were user pain points. I used this knowledge to create a high level user workflow diagram. Throughout the diagram, I added notes of major pain points present at different sections of the tool. Once my workflow diagram was created, I made a user persona based on my users as well as the research I conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="onepic">
            <img src="../ideation/radiclepersona.png" alt="A user persona of a member of the data team at Radicle." onclick="window.open('../ideation/radiclepersona.png', '_blank');">
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>After reviewing the research I have conducted, I indentified some things I could implement on the QC Tool to make the user experience better. For example, in one section of the QC Tool, there was an issue of inconsistent buttons throughout the whole user journey. One such instance of this was on the device tool page. If the user navigates to a different device using the device tree button on the device tool page, the device tree button disappears and is replaced by a back button, which takes the user to the previous device. The problem is that if the user wants to navigate to a different device on the device tree, they would have to go back to the previous device to access the new device. This can cause issues for the user, especially when they need to stay on the current device page as they are still working on it.</p>
        <p>Once I had an idea of what features should be added, I moved onto the prototyping phase. I created a mock-up of how I envisioned the features would look like on Figma. Once they were created, I found time with each of the members of the data team to discuss the mock-ups I created and recieved feedback. During the calls, I walked through the user flow of each of the new features as well as how the features would look like in the current software. All of the members of the data team responded positively about what I created, and I was able to push the deliverables onto the next stage, which is to be reviewed by Jenny and Stephan.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my time at Radicle came to an end before I could get the mock-ups reviewed by both of them. However, on my final day, I did manage to sneak in some time to do a quick 30 minute powerpoint presentation of my QC Tool research and designs. Overall, I got a lot of great feedback from each of my team members, and both Stephan and Jenny said that they will finish up the prototyping and push it onto implementation to the actual software.</p>
        <p class="heading">Final Touches<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">UX Audits</h2>
        <p>Over the whole course of my entire internship at Radicle, I also performed UX audits of the platform. During my time here, I've found over a dozen UX issues throughout the whole software. Those issues ranged from small (confusing buttons) to very big (links download files onto desktop without confirmation) that I've taken note of and listed out for Stephan and the developers to think about and fix. Additionally, since I used the software interface on the daily, I've also been able to suggested some features that could be implemented into the application that can improve the user reception.</p>
        <p class="heading">Conclusion<span class="blink">.</span></p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Reflection</h2>
        <p>Looking back at this internship, I had an amazing time and am really happy that Radicle and my team were willing to take me in as one of their interns. I've made some really amazing connections and have learned so much about both UX design and product management through my team's guidance. However, one thing that I wished I had done during my internship was to have more coffee chats with members of the other teams in our company. I know that there were other designers on the other teams here at Radicle, but I never took the initiative to chat with them and see if they had any UX advice for me. Also, since I was working remotely from Toronto during the internship, I wasn't able to meet my amazing team in person. This location difference also meant that I couldn't attend any of the fun events, such as the Calgary Stampede and picnics. Although I had these regrets, they pale in comparison with all the amazing moments I had working here. Thanks again to my supervisor Stephan and his team for making my time here so memorable!</p>
