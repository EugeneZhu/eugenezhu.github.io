        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <h2 class="heading">About<span class="blink">.</span></h2>
        <p>For our final project for our UI design class, we had to design a smartphone "app" using a collaborative UI prototyping tool like UXPin or Framer. The app had to demonstrate some form of logic in the user interface (i.e., not just be a sequence of predefined screens) and show some form of interaction with a (simulated) database.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Brainstorming/Research Phase</h2>
        <p>After our groups were finalized, my teammates and I discussed the type of app we wanted to make over Discord voice call. We listed all of the apps that we use regularly and narrowed down our selections based on the similar apps we used. We ended up choosing to make a food app since we all used food apps often and we believed that we could make an app with a feature that could give a better experience for users. Additionally, during this time, the COVID-19 lockdown was at it's peak, so food delivery applications were one of the apps that saw a major boom in usage since people couldn't go out to dine.</p>
        <p>We began this project by browsing through all food related apps we could find on the app store. Some examples of apps we investigated included SkipTheDishes, Mcdonalds, and Tasty. We looked through their user interfaces to figure out how their user flows work as well as how they design their overall site to make the application accessible and easy to use for the user. We discussed our ideas and took notes over Discord voice call.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>For the first phase of this project, we had to do user research based on the app we want to design. Since the COVID-19 pandemic was going on at this time, we could not conduct in-person interviews, so instead we decided to do some interviews over Discord voice chat as well as over text messaging regarding food delivery apps and the interviewee's user experiences using them. We got our interviewees to download a variety of food apps such as Uber Eats, Starbucks Mobile, Hello Fresh, etc. We then got the interviewees to use the apps for a few minutes and then asked them a few app-related questions. Some examples of questions we asked them included the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="jakarta" style="text-align: left; margin: 2em;">
            <li class="smallmargin">What is your skill level with the application, or similar sorts of applications?</li>
            <li class="smallmargin">Are there things that frustrate or ease your use of the application?</li>
            <li>What might you have tried to do that was not clearly possible with the application?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These questions were vital for us to get information about, since we were aiming to design an app that had a better user experience and interface compared to already existing food delivery apps. After getting ample user research, we created three main app ideas catered for different users.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>After getting feedback, we narrowed our idea down to one main one, which is the food randomization idea in a food delivery application.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Problem Space</h2>
        <p>While conducting user interviews as well as doing online research, we discovered that most of the people we interviewed and the research we found online had one main issue with food delivery apps and food in general. The issue is that people typically spend a lot more time than usual on these food delivery apps due to the fact that these apps are often overloaded with food items and deals, making it hard to choose what to eat. Additionally, according to a New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/17/american-couples-spend-5-5-days-a-year-deciding-what-to-eat/" target="_blank" class="linklight blacktext">article</a>, "The average American couple spends 132 hours a year deciding what to eat," which is a lot of time wasted that could be put into doing something more productive.</p>
        <p>To get around this issue, my teammates and I decided to make a food delivery app with a food randomizer. This randomizer would allow users to put different types of foods they want to eat into a data collection, and the randomizer would help the user choose a random food dish so that they don't have to choose themselves. This randomizer will be completely optional for the user, and they can add settings to it depending on the type of eater they are so that they do not get given a food dish they cannot eat. We also wanted to add an element of fun to the application itself so that the user wouldn't feel like choosing their meal is a chore.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">First Iteration: Finalizing our Idea, Sketches + Mockups</h2>
        <p>    
        Once we had the concept fleshed out, we began the next phase of our project, which was to create user personas for our app and features. These user personas were based on real people who use food delivery apps and is the target audience for our feature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <p>We also created some rough mock-ups and sketches to prepare us for the next phase of the project, which is the prototyping phase. We worked on the sketches together through Discord voice call and illustrated them using Photoshop and Indesign. We based our overall layouts on existing food delivery apps similar to the one we were making and changed the overall layout to match our style and theme of our overall company. We also create a user flow that showcases how the user would use the application and access our feature. Once we had the sketches created, we moved onto making the mock-ups in Figma and Framer.</p>

        <div class="lefttext pmargin">
        <h2 class="heading">Second Iteration: Prototyping</h2>
        <p>On the next phase of our project, we refined our sketches and mock-ups and made them into prototypes. We used Figma to make the prototypes and then imported them into Framer to view the app. After making a basic useable prototype with buttons and logical UI flow, we got some friends and classmates to critique the usability and test for any bugs and errors in the app. We also asked them questions about our app to gauge whether or not our app was successful in what we wanted it to do. Some questions we asked included:
        </p>
        <ul class="jakarta" style="text-align: left; margin: 2em;">
            <li class="smallmargin">What is the main function of this app?</li>
            <li class="smallmargin">Do you think the overall design of the app is suitable for the type of app this is for?</li>
            <li class="smallmargin">Imagine you are using this app to order a meal. Starting from the login page, how easy is it to complete an order compared to other similar apps?</li>
            <li class="smallmargin">Is there anything you think should be changed/added to this app?</li>
            <li>Would you use this app over other similar apps like UberEats or SkipTheDishes? Why or why not?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Third Iteration: Fixing UI Errors, Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>
        After getting feedback, we managed to find a lot of usability issues, including broken links as well as phone resolution errors, and brainstormed ways to fix these usability errors through quick digital sketches created on Photoshop. Once we shared our designs and finalized our changes, we added them to the application by changing the interfaces on Figma and then re-imported them into Framer. We did a final round of user testing, and we were able to present our application to our class.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Final Result<span class="blink">.</span></h2>
        <p>We knew our feature was a success because on our final round of user testing, we were able to get positive responses from all of our user testers. They commented that the randomized food feature is unique from other food apps and was a useful feature that can create a better user experience for the user. As well, it added an element of fun to the rather mundane task of choosing what to eat. Based on the data we collected, we also saw that our app reduced time spent ordering food by almost half, which was another success. However, there were a few issues with the overall usability of the app, with some users saying that it was hard to differentiate between buttons and normal text and images. Thus, if we had more time to work on the overall interface, we would work on improving the overall clarity of the app. </p>
