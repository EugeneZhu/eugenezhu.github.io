        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>For this project, I had to design a new feature for an already existing web application. This feature must improve the user experience of the user in some way. I chose to do my project on the instant messaging platform Discord, as I use it often. Below is my design process for this project.</p>
        <h3>Brainstorming/Research Phase</h3>
        <p>To start off this project, I needed to do some research about Discord itself as well as how people use it. Thus, I conducted interviews during the first week with my fellow friends who also used Discord. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown affecting us during this time, I had to conduct interviews virtually, and got feedback through voice call on the Discord app. I asked them about their thoughts on the application as well as what frustrates them most about the platform.</p>
        <p>These interviews were done to help me get a grasp of how interactions between the user and the interface affected their overall experience, and thus I asked the interviewees three specific questions.</p>
        <ul class="jakarta" style="text-align: left; margin: 2em;">
            <li>What is your skill level with the application, or similar sorts of applications?</li>
            <li>Are there things that frustrate or ease your use of the application?</li>
            <li>What might you have tried to do that was not clearly possible with the application?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>First Iteration: Feature Creation</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, I did not record the interviews done over voice call. However, I did get plenty of valuable information that I translated into my feature proposals. I found that there were a few similar answers to the questions listed, and thus I created three possible features that I could move on with based on my research. After finalizing the details of each feature, I presented it to my professor as well as my fellow students to get feedback on each feature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ideationpic">
                <img src="../ideation/Feature_1.jpg" alt="An edited Discord layout featuring a bio section in the profile." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Feature_1.jpg', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
                <img src="../ideation/Feature_2.jpg" alt="An edited Discord layout featuring a mic button in the chat bar." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Feature_2.jpg', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
                <img src="../ideation/Feature_3.jpg" alt="An edited Discord layout featuring a pop-up section confirming that the user wants to join voice chat upon pressing it." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Feature_3.jpg', '_blank');" loading="lazy"/>
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext">
        <p>After presenting it to the class and getting feedback, I ultimately descided to choose to carry on with the third feature, which is a Server Voice Chat Setting.</p>
        <h3>Why this feature?</h3>
        <p>I made this feature because many of the people I interviewed used the Discord voice chat function constantly, and one major problem they found was that upon joining a voice channel, Discord does not automatically mute their mic. It only mutes the mic if it was already previously muted by the user in their previous voice chat. This is a major problem because it can cause privacy issues for the user, since some people might not be aware their mic is on when talking about something private when they join the voice channel. Thus, the feature I would implement would be a pop-up that shows up everytime a user joins a voice channel. Upon joining the voice channel, Discord will ask the user if they want to join the voice channel with their mic on or off.</p>
        <p>As well, another problem that voice chat users can experience is that they accidentally forget to unmute themselves when talking about something important to the other people in the voice channel, which can affect the experience of the user as well. Thus, I created a voice chat feature that detects speech and sound, and when it does, it give the user a pop-up telling them that Discord has detected speech even though the user is muted. The pop-up would have two options for the user, one of which continues to mute the user's mic, while the other unmutes the mic. Since I know that some users would not like this feature as it might be a privacy issue due to Discord listening to the user's mic, there would also be a setting in the voice settings allowing the user to turn off this feature from being used to give the user peace of mind.</p>
        <h3>Second Iteration: User Persona, Final Sketches</h3>
        <p>To begin the next phase, I started by creating a user persona for my Discord feature. This user persona helped me determine what kind of user I was designing for and how they would benefit from using my feature. I also kept the user persona as realistic to a real person as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="onepic">
        <img id = "borderradius" class="persona" src="../ideation/Persona.jpg" alt="A user persona created for the design feature explained in the process analysis." onclick="window.open('../ideation/Persona.jpg', '_blank');"/>
        </div>
        <div class="lefttext">
        <p>Once my user persona was created, I presented it to the class and started to create the final mock-up of the feature.</p>
        <h3>Third Iteration: Final Mockup</h3>
        <p>At this stage of the project, I ran into some problems in creating the mock-ups of the feature. Firstly, since I did not have access to the font Discord uses for it's text, I could not make a completely accurate layout. Thus, I had to use a font that closely resembles the font Discord uses. The second problem I ran into was when I got some people to give my mock-up some feedback. One piece of feedback I got was that having this same pop-up appear every single time a user joins a voice channel would be annoying and would reduce the user experience. Thus, after getting this feedback, I decided to add a "Don't ask again" option that allows the user to remove the pop-up from appearing. The setting would also be available in the Discord voice settings section in case the user wanted to turn it back on.</p>
        <p>Below is my final mock-up prototype of the feature.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Overall, I am satisfied with my feature and final mockup. I think that this would be a valuable feature for Discord to implement as there are times where I also run into the same problems involving voice channels. However, if I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely create a Discord prototype of this feature as well as get some more user feedback and user testing.</p>
